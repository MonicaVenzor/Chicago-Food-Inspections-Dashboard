Chicago Food Inspections â€“ Quick Project Summary

ðŸ”¹ What I Did

Worked with the Chicago Department of Public Health â€“ Food Inspections dataset (~297k rows).

Cleaned and standardized messy data using Excel Power Query (M language).

Built pivot tables and charts in Excel to explore results, risks, and violations.

Designed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to highlight trends and key insights.
