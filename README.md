# Chicago Food Inspections – Data Analytics Project  

## Quick Summary  
This project explores **~297,000 food inspection records** from the City of Chicago.  
I worked through the **entire analytics process**: cleaning messy raw data, transforming it for analysis, and building an **interactive dashboard** to highlight key insights.  

- Cleaned and standardized the dataset using **Excel Power Query (M language)**  
- Created exploratory analysis with **PivotTables and PivotCharts**  
- Built a **Power BI dashboard** with filters, KPIs, and visuals for storytelling  

 Dataset: [Chicago Food Inspections – data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-inspections)

## Dataset  
- **Source:** Public dataset from the Chicago Department of Public Health  
- **Size:** ~297,000 rows  
- **Key fields:**  
  - Inspection ID  
  - Business / Facility Type  
  - Inspection Date (Year, Month extracted)  
  - Results (Pass, Fail, Other)  
  - Risk (High, Medium, Low)  
  - Violations (codes & descriptions)  
  - Location (City, Address, Zip)

## Data Cleaning – Excel Power Query (M)  
The raw data had plenty of issues: typos, inconsistent categories, duplicates, and free-text violations.  

**Steps I took:**  
- Standardized city names (e.g., *Cchicago, Chciago → Chicago*)  
- Grouped facility types (e.g., *Bakery/Restaurant → Bakery*)  
- Simplified results into 3 buckets: **Pass, Fail, Other**  
- Expanded violations into rows, extracted valid codes (0–70)  
- Added time features (Year, Month) for trend analysis  
- Created flags (`Fail_Flag`, `Total_Flag`) to support KPI calculations  

---

## Data Modeling – Power BI  
- Added a **Date Table** for time intelligence  
- Built DAX measures:  
  - Total inspections  
  - Failed inspections  
  - Fail rate %  
  - Violations count  
  - % of fails in High Risk facilities  
- Connected **Food_Inspections** with the violations table for deeper analysis  

---

## Dashboard Highlights  
The dashboard was designed to be **clean, modern, and easy to interpret**.  

### KPIs  
- Total inspections  
- Failed inspections  
- Total violations  
- % of High Risk fails  

### Visuals  
- Pass vs Fail (donut)  
- Failures by Facility Type (bar)  
- Risk Level breakdown (donut)  
- Trend of inspections over time (line)  
- Chicago vs Suburbs + Top 10 Cities (bar)  
- Most common violations (bar & treemap)  

### Filters  
- Year  
- Facility Type  
- Risk Level  
- City  

---

## Key Insights  
- **Restaurants** dominate both inspections and failures.  
- **High Risk facilities** drive ~74% of all failures.  
- Most inspections happen in **Chicago**, but suburbs like Evanston and Cicero also show relevant patterns.  
- **Sanitation and temperature control** are the most frequent violations.  
- Failures remain stable over time with minor seasonal variation.
